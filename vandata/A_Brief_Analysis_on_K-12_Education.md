# A Brief Analysis on K-12 Education

K-12, the catchy shorthand for the educational journey from Kindergarten to Grade 12, is more than just a sequence of grades; it's a stepping stone that paves the way to a brighter future. Join me on an exciting journey as we dive into the intriguing world of K-12 education in the vibrant regions of British Columbia (BC) and the bustling metropolis of Metro Vancouver.

## K-12 Education in BC

In the picturesque province of British Columbia, the adventure of learning is compulsory for all children aged 6 to 16. Here, the educational landscape comprises two main chapters: elementary (also known as primary) and secondary (also known as high school) education. These chapters unfold from Kindergarten to Grade 12, creating a captivating narrative of growth and development.

BC's young learners take their first steps into full-day Kindergarten at the tender age of five, embarking on an educational odyssey that propels them through elementary school, with graduation typically occurring at the age of 13. The journey continues into secondary school, commencing at 14 and culminating with graduation at 18, crowned with a coveted graduation certificate. Upon reaching this milestone, students can choose to venture into the realms of higher education, vocational training, or even dive headfirst into the workforce.

### School-Aged Population

Delving into the data from Statistics Canada, we uncover a fascinating narrative of change. Between 2000 and 2020, the school-aged population (ages 5-17) experienced a mesmerizing 0.2 percent decline across ten Canadian provinces. This trend swept across the nation, leaving only Alberta and Manitoba untouched. British Columbia witnessed a gentle ebb of 4.5 percent, while Newfoundland & Labrador navigated the most dramatic shift, with a staggering 28.3 percent reduction in its school-aged population.

### School Type

When it comes to K-12 education in Canada, there are three distinctive avenues:

**Public Schools:** These vibrant hubs of knowledge, funded by the public, welcome students from every corner of the nation, free of charge. A whopping 90.7 percent of Canadian children choose this educational adventure.

**Independent Schools:** These institutions, privately owned and operated, beckon parents to invest in their children's education. Approximately 7.7 percent of Canadian students embark on this enriching journey, though tuition fees can vary widely.

**Homeschooling:** For those who seek a more personalized approach, homeschooling provides a unique path. Regulations vary across provinces, but parents often find a wealth of curriculum options and support online. About 1.6 percent of Canadian children embrace the freedom of homeschooling.

Peering into the educational landscape, public schools emerge as the undisputed stars, captivating 97.63 percent of Newfoundland & Labrador's students in the 2020-2021 school year. Meanwhile, British Columbia, with its diverse choices, registers a lower public school enrollment rate at 85.8 percent.

Moreover, British Columbia takes the lead in independent school enrollment, boasting 13.35 percent of students in this category, followed closely by Quebec at 11.62 percent. In contrast, the Atlantic Provinces feature notably lower levels of independent school enrollment.

Homeschooling, though a smaller piece of the educational puzzle, finds a niche in Manitoba, where 3.97 percent of students opt for this distinctive learning journey. In three provinces, homeschooling claims less than 1 percent of the student population.

Over the past two decades, the landscape of education has evolved. Every province witnessed a surge in independent school enrollments, with British Columbia's numbers soaring from 8.7 percent to an impressive 13.4 percent, representing nearly one in every eight students. In contrast, Alberta's growth remained steady, inching from 4.1 percent to 4.2 percent over the same period.

## K-12 International Students

Fast forward to 2022, and the world of K-12 education in Canada welcomes an influx of international students. Over 65,200 students from around the globe choose Canada as their educational destination, marking a remarkable 44 percent increase from the previous year. While British Columbia experienced a 10 percent growth rate, Alberta stood as the hottest spot, with an impressive 83 percent surge in international student approvals.

What fuels this transformation? While the allure of metropolitan areas like Vancouver remains, factors like affordable housing, cost of living, and immigration policies take center stage for prospective international students.

In a surprising twist, elementary school student approvals eclipsed those of secondary students in 2022. This shift marks a significant change in the international education landscape, as historically, secondary students dominated. Elementary approvals witnessed a meteoric fivefold rise compared to their secondary counterparts.

Peering into the origins of these eager young learners, India, Philippines, and China lead the pack. Among the top five origin regions, four hail from Asia, with Ukraine stealing the spotlight with over 3,300 elementary student approvals. This surge can be attributed to recent geopolitical conflicts in Europe and Canada's initiative to waive application fees for Ukrainian students.

The story continues in the realm of secondary education. In 2022, China's flag flies high, with a significantly larger number of international secondary students compared to other regions.

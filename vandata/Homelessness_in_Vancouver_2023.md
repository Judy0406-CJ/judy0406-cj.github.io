# Homelessness in Vancouver 2023

The issue of homelessness has reached critical proportions in Metro Vancouver, impacting urban, suburban, and rural areas alike. This article delves into the evolving landscape of homelessness, drawing insights from the [2023 Homeless Count in Greater Vancouver](https://hsa-bc.ca/_Library/2023_HC/2023_Homeless_Count_for_Greater_Vancouver.pdf) conducted by the Homelessness Services Association of BC.

## The Magnitude of Homelessness

It's crucial to acknowledge that any count of homelessness represents an underestimation. The figures provided by the PiT Methodology offer a snapshot, but individuals accessing services and shelters are more likely to be accounted for than those who are not.

> And for the region indicated in the article, the North Shore includes North Vancouver District, North Vancouver City and West Vancouver, Langley includes Langley City and Langley Township, Tri-Cities includes Port Coquitlam, Port Moody and Coquitlam, Ridge Meadows includes Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadowns.

## Conclusion

While the data sheds light on homelessness trends, it's vital to recognize the inherent limitations in capturing the full extent of the issue. Addressing homelessness requires multifaceted approaches, including improved access to medical care, expanded shelter infrastructure, and policy measures such as raising the Old Age Security (OAS) pension. By understanding the complexities of homelessness, we can work towards meaningful solutions to improve the lives of those affected.

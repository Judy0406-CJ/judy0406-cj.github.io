# Vancouver Rental Market 2023

The Vancouver rental market can be dissected into two primary categories: the primary rental market and the secondary rental market. The former encompasses purpose-built housing intended for rental purposes, including both market (private) and non-market (owned or operated by government or non-profit organizations) segments. On the other hand, the secondary rental market consists of privately-owned properties currently rented out, such as detached homes, laneway houses, secondary suites, townhomes, and rental condominiums. Notably, secondary rental housing lacks the security of its primary counterpart, as owners can withdraw units from the rental market at any time.

This article analyzes rental market in Metro Vancouver based on data from Canada Mortgage Housing Corporation (CMHC), and it is noteworthy that CMHC's primary rental market data only includes purpose-built rental apartments and townhouses, and CMHC's secondary rental market data includes rental condominiums only.

## Primary Rental Market

In Metro Vancouver, purpose-built market rental units represent about one-third of all rental units in the region.

### Average Rents of Vacant and Occupied Units

Understanding the difference in rent between vacant and occupied units sheds light on the challenges faced by those seeking rental homes. The asking rents for vacant units are higher than the rents of occupied units as annual rent increases in occupied units are limited by a maximum allowable rate set out by the BC Government each year.

#### Key Observations

* In 2023, the average asking rent for a vacant unit in Metro Vancouver was `$2,159`, 18.3% higher than the average rent for an occupied unit. This gap decreased by over 20% since 2022.

* Larger units, particularly those with 3 bedrooms or more (26.9%; `$665`), and 2 bedrooms (19.9%; `$434`), exhibited the most significant difference in rent between vacant and occupied units.

* The notable difference underscores the challenges faced by larger households, primarily families, during relocations.

### Vacancy Rates

Vacancy rates serve as a key indicator of the rental market's health, with rates around 3% to 5% considered balanced.

#### Key Observations

* Metro Vancouver's vacancy rates varied from 2000 to 2023 but consistently remained below the healthy 3% threshold.

* The COVID-19 pandemic led to a spike in the regional vacancy rate in 2020, reaching 2.6%, the highest in the last 20 years.

* Historically, low vacancy rates correlated with increased rent costs. In 2022, a slight vacancy rate decrease coincided with a steep increase in average annual rent. With the vacancy rate at 0.9% in 2023, average annual rent surged by 9.5%, the highest level since 2000.

## Conclusion

The rental market in Metro Vancouver remained tight in 2023, with average vacancy rates for both purpose-built rental apartments and townhouses and rental condominiums holding steady at 0.9%. The surge in immigration to British Columbia added further strain, as newcomers, often renters, sought housing. Simultaneously, escalating mortgage costs and higher income requirements likely delayed home purchases, keeping potential buyers in the rental market.

Affordability waned, with rent growth outpacing average wage growth by a considerable margin. Lower-income renters faced heightened pressure and often opted for more affordable but smaller units or shared living arrangements that fit their budget but may not meet their housing needs.

Addressing the growing demand and ensuring affordability requires concerted efforts to enhance the rental supply. Action is imperative to create a balanced and accessible rental market in Metro Vancouver.

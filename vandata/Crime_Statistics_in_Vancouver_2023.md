## Conclusion

In 2023, Metro Vancouver experienced diverse crime trends, with fluctuations in both the Crime Severity Index and specific types of violations. While property crimes remained a significant portion of overall crime, violent crime rates, including homicides and firearm offenses, showed notable decreases. The CSI in Metro Vancouver remained relatively stable compared to the larger increases seen in other areas of British Columbia and across Canada. However, certain regions within Metro Vancouver, such as Langley City and Surrey, exhibited rising crime severity, whereas others like Bowen Island demonstrated much lower crime rates, reflecting the varied nature of crime distribution in the area.

These findings highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and localized intervention strategies to address crime dynamics effectively and maintain public safety across the region.
